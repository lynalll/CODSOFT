echo "# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The **Movie Rating Prediction Project** aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the ratings of movies based on various features such as genre, director, and more. This project leverages historical movie data to analyze patterns and factors that influence how movies are rated by viewers and critics.

### Goals
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a regression model to accurately estimate movie ratings.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand how different features contribute to ratings.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process and prepare the data for model training, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

### Key Features
- Uses **linear regression** for predicting ratings based on features.
- Involves **data preprocessing** steps such as handling missing values and one-hot encoding of categorical data.
- Compares actual and predicted ratings to evaluate model performance.

### Importance
This project not only helps in predicting movie ratings but also provides insights into the aspects that contribute to a movie's success or failure based on audience feedback. It serves as a practical application of machine learning techniques in the entertainment industry." > task2/Movie-Rating-Prediction/README.md
